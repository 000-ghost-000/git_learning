# so lets talk about what is this repo...

* basically this repo is about my notes that i made in the `.md` format for the interesting topic of `git` 

* these notes are written using the note taking app named as `obsidian` 

#### these notes are written for the Debian based operating system cause i wrote it for myself basically

* sooo i am sorry window users , you have to google some stuff 

* this note is made during a lecture of YouTube by freecodecamp and the link to that video and an extensive documentation by git and GitHub too are in the [[git 00]] file 

* there is also an index file [[index]] it doesn't have much but you can feel free to roam and scan that too , it was created cause i thought i am gonna make a mess writing the notes but everything turned out just fine 

* each notes page is time stamped so you know when the file was created and i encourage you to read the timestamp and keep the version of git in check for latest patches and updates

```bash
git --version
```

use this command to check the version of git you are using 

`git version 2.39.5` this is my current git version so check the patches and updates respectively before 

* git is a very reliable software that is not going to be change for a long time period so you might be good to go
